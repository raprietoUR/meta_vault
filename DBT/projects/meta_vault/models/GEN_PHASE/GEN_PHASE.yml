- name: GEN_INIT
  description: Initiates the phase
- name: GEN_END
- name: NPSA_LOAD_DATASETS_0
  description: Table that collects the data from the dataset_tmp table adding the
    columns to the datasets table they belong to. Since these elements represent hubs
    and links, they are historical, materialized, and inclemental tables.
- name: NPSA_LOAD_DATASETS_1
  description: This table contains the datasets of the segments related to hubs. The
    information is enriched with the data of the datasets, determining if it is multi-active
    and they are historical, materialized and inclement tables.
- name: NPSA_LOAD_DATASETS_2
  description: This table contains the datasets of the hubs, links and satellites
    related to hubs
- name: NPSA_LOAD_DATASETS_3
  description: Table that has the datasets from snapshots table (bdv - custom elements)
    determining the type of load and enriched with the datasets information.
